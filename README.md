If you came here to know me, here are my message towards you.      

--- 

If you are a Jew or Christian,      
"Say: 'O People of the Book! Let us come to common terms that we will worship none but Allah, associate none with Him, nor take one another as lords instead of Allah.‚Äù But if they turn away, then say, 'Bear witness that we have submitted Àπto Allah aloneÀ∫.‚Äù [Al-Qur'aan 3:64](https://quran.com/3/64)

If you are a Hindu or Buddhist,      
"Are different gods better or Allah, the One, the All-Dominant? Whatever ÀπidolsÀ∫ you worship instead of Him are mere names which you and your forefathers have made up1‚Äîa practice Allah has never authorized. It is only Allah Who decides. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the upright faith, but most people do not know." [Al-Qur'aan 12:39-40](https://quran.com/12/39-40)

If you are an Atheist,      
"Or were they created by nothing, or are they Àπtheir ownÀ∫ creators? Or have they created the heavens and the earth? No, but they are sure of nothing. Or do they possess the treasuries of your Lord, or are they in control Àπof everythingÀ∫?" [Al-Qur'aan 52:35-37](https://quran.com/52/35-37)
